# Pug ESM Template for Express.js

Tired of writing ES module (ESM) code for your Express.js projects? Look no further! This template provides a ready-to-use Express.js project template written in ES modules and uses Pug as the template engine. It's a perfect starting point for your next web application.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShivanshKothari/pug-esm-template.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd pug-esm-template
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the server using `nodemon`, which automatically restarts the server when you make changes.

## Project Structure

- `bin/www`: Entry point for the server.
- `public/`: Static files (CSS, images, etc.).
- `routes/`: Express routes.
- `views/`: Pug templates.
